# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview
The **Multiple Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of three major health conditions:
1. **Diabetes**
2. **Heart Disease**
3. **Parkinson's Disease**

By analyzing user-provided health metrics, the system leverages trained machine learning models to provide accurate and reliable predictions, enabling early diagnosis and timely medical consultation.
