# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview
The **Multiple Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of three major health conditions:
1. **Diabetes**
2. **Heart Disease**
3. **Parkinson's Disease**

By analyzing user-provided health metrics, the system leverages trained machine learning models to provide accurate and reliable predictions, enabling early diagnosis and timely medical consultation.

## Features
- Predicts the risk of **Diabetes** using factors like glucose levels, BMI, and age.
- Assesses the likelihood of **Heart Disease** using metrics such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and chest pain type.
- Detects the probability of **Parkinson's Disease** based on voice-related attributes.
- **Streamlit-based Web Interface** for an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
- **Hosted Application**: Try the system live [here](https://multiplehealthdiseasegit-8mdfyqjobzo7gz8zxdyd4b.streamlit.app/).
